# GradePredictor-OOP-Based-Student-Performance-Estimator

GradePredictor is a terminal-based, object-oriented Python project that predicts student final grades based on study time, assignment performance, and attendance. It uses a simple linear regression model (via scikit-learn) and emphasizes clean OOP design with practical input/output logic.

## Features

- Collects student data via terminal input
- Predicts course performance using `LinearRegression`
- Demonstrates solid OOP principles with `Student`, `Course`, and `Predictor` classes
- CLI interface, no external files needed
- Easily extendable with CSV, GUI, or database support

## Installation & Running

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the app
python main.py
```

## Example Interaction

```
Course Performance Predictor
Enter course name: Software Engineering
How many students do you want to evaluate? 2

--- New Student ---
Enter student name: Elif
How many hours did Elif study? 10
What was Elif's midterm score (out of 100)? 85
What was Elif's attendance rate (in %)? 90

--- New Student ---
Enter student name: Can
How many hours did Can study? 7
What was Can's assignment score (out of 100)? 75
What was Can's attendance rate (in %)? 80

Predicted final grades for Software Engineering:
Elif: 85.00
Can: 76.00
```

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Possible Future Improvements

- CSV file support (import/export)
- GUI version (Tkinter or Streamlit)
- Web API version with Flask or FastAPI
- Additional ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)
